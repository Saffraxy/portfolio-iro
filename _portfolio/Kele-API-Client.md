<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Kele is a Ruby Gem API client used to access the Bloc API.</p>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>For this assignment we were instructed to create an application that works similarly to a todo list where the user can add and cross-off items from their list and the list would update without having to manually refresh the page.
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Some problems I encountered here were with JSON.  Trying to get the code to work properly in order to have items delete immediately as soon as the user clicked the checkbox took me a few tries and I asked for guidance from my mentor in order to get everything to run smoothly.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>I was really happy to have figured out how to get the items to add and delete properly without having to refresh the pages. I felt like a superhero! Ha ha!</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here are a few images from the final product.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project taught me how to work with JSON and get pages to dynamically refresh without the user having to do anything more than click a button.</p>
