short-description: Blocmetrics is an analytics service to track events on websites.

---

## Summary
Blocmetrics is an application that allows users to create public and private Markdown-based wikis.

## Explanation
For this assignment we were instructed to create an application that tracks all the stats for a user's website such as:
<li>A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to track events on their website.</li>
<li>A server-side API that captures and saves those events to a database.</li>
<li>A Rails application that displays the captured event data for a user.</li>

## Problem
Some problems I encountered here involved some of the same old basic stumbling blocks, such as with JSON refreshing automatically once an application was registered. Each time I stumble though, I feel like I get better at it.

## Solution
I got the JSON to work by looking at my old code for Blocitoff and getting some advice from my mentor, etc., and also was really happy to have figured out how to display the event data for a user. I mean, the whole thing was great to learn, but displaying the stats as charts and graphs was a lot of fun.

## Results

#### Here are a few images from the final product.

First off, here is the main landing page after signing in. Are you experiencing deja vu?  Yeah, well, to save time I copied the layout of Blocitoff since I'd just finished that project before starting this one. Not very exciting, but gets the job done. :)

Once you click on a registered application, this is the page you are brought to showing your stats for that application. Now it's your turn to be amazed by the pretty colors. ;)

## Conclusion
To tell you the truth the hardest part of this project was getting my head wrapped around the entire concept of what was supposed to happen. What does it mean to register an application and track events? Huh? What's an application, is that a website? And what events are we tracking? What is considered to be "an event"? This probably sounds completely ridiculous but BLOC never actually defined the word "event" while describing what to do with them. I seriously felt like I needed to pull out my "programming terms for dummies" book or something. Ha ha! Anyway, the good news is that I was able to program it all before fully even understanding what was going to happen and then, when I saw the mostly finished product, my brain kicked in. Oh I get it now! :) Also, I gotta say, once I got everything to work it was a lot of fun seeding my event data with star wars characters. Supercool! Anyway, the most important thing, of course, is that I know analytics are important to any website so am hoping this too will be valuable in the real world. :)
