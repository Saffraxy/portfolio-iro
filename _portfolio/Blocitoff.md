## Summary
Blocitoff is an application that allows users to create self-destructing to-do lists.

## Explanation
For this assignment we were instructed to create an application that works similarly to a todo list where the user can add and cross-off items from their list and the list would update without having to manually refresh the page.

## Problem
Some problems I encountered here were with JSON. Trying to get the code to work properly in order to have items delete immediately as soon as the user clicked the checkbox took me a few tries and I asked for guidance from my mentor in order to get everything to run smoothly.

## Solution
I was really happy to have figured out how to get the items to add and delete properly without having to refresh the pages. I felt like a superhero! Ha ha!

## Results

#### Here is a sample image from the final product.

After signing in this is the page where the user lands, and where the user may add or delete items from their todo list. In order to delete an item the user just needs to click the checkmark, and instantly the item is removed.

## Conclusion
This project taught me how to work with JSON and get pages to dynamically refresh without the user having to do anything more than click a button. Supercool.
