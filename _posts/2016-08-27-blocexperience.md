title: My experience at BLOC
---

Well, what can I say about my experience with BLOC so far? Hmmm, at times it's been hard.  More than once I came across words in the actual assignment that I had to Google the definition for. Even during this Portfolio section there is a line that says:

```
To display your project's screenshots, create assets and include
them in the markdown file:
```

What the heck is an asset? I had NO idea. Only because they mentioned screen shots and also included this code:

```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/blocflix.png)
```

did I think, well it must be some kind of image? I am assuming this is pretty normal when you change careers and have to learn all new lingo. Even JSON-- How do coders pronounce that? Is is like "JAY-SUN" (the name) or is it like "JAY-SON". My mentor told me before but it was while we were working on it, which means I was trying to figure out how to get it to run properly, so I didn't register how to pronounce it.

So of course, the hard parts always made me feel really, really dumb. My sister was enrolled in DevBootcamp at the same time and she said everyone in her class felt dumb all the time too so apparently it's normal. My Mentor too often tried to make me feel better, letting me know that there are many ways to code the same thing, and how I was really close to the solution sometimes, and cheered me on whenever I got it right.

Aside from the hard parts, the material itself was great to learn.  I love completing a project-- even if I had stumbled along the way on it-- and feeling that sense of accomplishment that I was able to figure it out. Super fun. I am really looking forward to the second half of the course as well.  I hope at the end I really feel well  rounded in both the front and back ends of programming.
