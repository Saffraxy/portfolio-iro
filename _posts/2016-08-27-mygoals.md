title: My goals as a web developer
---
So here we are finishing up the first half of the Full Stack Web Development course, and so far my goals are still the same as when I began. Basically, I have been a statistical research/data analyst for the past 20 years and I feel like my career has stalled, or rather I have simply lost interest in it. I need to change tracks and find a career in a more interesting field. After some serious thought I realized there was one that I have always had interest in but never moved into beyond the basics previously; that is, Web Development. I have realized over the years that my favorite part of being an analyst has always been coding, so I knew I would enjoy delving deeper into a coding career. To me coding is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle: hard work but so much fun and such a great feeling when you complete the entire puzzle/project. Especially with web development, it has been a real treat being able to see the product of my work online.
